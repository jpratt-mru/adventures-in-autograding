# Adventures in Autograding

Some notes put together to capture the suffering I went through so that it doesn't happen again.

- [an overview](overview.md)
- [how things look like from a student's viewpoint](sample-student-run.md)
- [what work](instructor-work.md) does the instructor have to do?
- [a checklist](the-checklist.md) to follow when creating an assessment

## Code and tools needed to play along

- a [starting Eclipse template](https://github.com/jpratt-mru/starting-autograded-template.git) that contains an [important GitHub Workflow file](talking-about-workflow.md)
- a tool called [cissumarizer]([cissumarizer.md](https://github.com/jpratt-mru/cisummarizer)) for summarizing results
- a tool called [Arty the Miner](arty.md) for harvesting submissions
