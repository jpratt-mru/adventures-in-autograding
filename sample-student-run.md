# A Sample Student Run

Let's walk through the steps that a student would take to complete an assessment.

I'm using a "real" quiz from fall 2019 that I made and gave to my 1501 students.

## The Steps

1. Go to https://classroom.github.com/a/oVSuSWsm to accept the assignment.

- **result** a repo with the starting template is created and you are given non-admin access to that repo. A link to that repo is provided in the web browser after a few moments.
- **result** an email is sent informing you that a pull request has been created so that your instructor can leave feedback about your work. [this is an option that you are given when you create a GitHub Assignment - it could be super-confusing to students, so would recommend treading carefully here]
